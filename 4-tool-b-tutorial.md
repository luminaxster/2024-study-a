# SeeCode.Run Tutorial

## Introduction

[SeeCode.Run](https://seecode.run/) `(SCR)` is a platform to rapidly prototype your web app ideas. It unifies exploring, navigating, and searching through your code as it runs, streamlining your development from imagination to application.

## Stream-Driven Programming

**Editors**:

As you work on your code, SCR will automatically bundle your HTML, CSS, and JS, presenting them as the output.

   - **HTML**: Add your markup in the HTML section.
   - **CSS**: Style your page using the CSS section.
   - **JavaScript**: Program interactivity in the JavaScript section, this is editor is **Stream-Driven**.

In SCR, The JavaScript editor is `Stream-Driven`, so every line of code shows its current program state. You can **explore** each expression as you normally would in a breakpoint debugger, without being limited by a time-forward stream.

## Stream-driven 

Different from breakpoint debuggers, SCR offers time-traveling as stream navigation, allowing you to go back and forth through functions and loops. You can search for values and locate elements in the output, all simultaneously.

### Explore
Let's take a look at the stream happening in this code:

From the screenshot above, expressions that do not execute are greyed out.

As soon the execute, they are vividly colored.

The stream also shows a snapshot of the program state at that point.

Your program has different states, some represent data, others references to functions and other data structures, and others let you manipulate your app's visual elements.

# SeeCode.Run Tutorial

## Introduction

[SeeCode.Run](https://seecode.run/) `(SCR)` is a platform to rapidly prototype your web app ideas. It unifies exploring, navigating, and searching through your code as it runs, streamlining your development from imagination to application.

## SeeCode.Run Programming

**Editors**:

As you work on your code, SCR will automatically bundle your HTML, CSS, and JS, presenting them as the output.

   - **HTML**: Add your markup in the HTML section.
   - **CSS**: Style your page using the CSS section.
   - **JavaScript**: Program interactivity in the JavaScript section, this is editor is a **SCR Live Editor** :one:.

In SCR, The JavaScript editor is `Live`, so every line of code shows its current **program state** :two: You can **explore** each expression as you normally would in a breakpoint debugger, without being limited by a time-forward execution flow.

## Live See Code's Editor and Run Info

Different from breakpoint debuggers, SCR offers time-traveling as **inline navigation** :three:, allowing you to go back and forth through functions and loops. You can search for values and locate elements in the output, all simultaneously.

### See and Search everywhere, all at once

The Live Editor also shows a snapshot of the program state at that point.

Your program has different states, some represent data, others references to functions and other data structures, and others let you manipulate your app's **visual elements** :four: right to your web app **output** :five:.


Now, let's see how asynchronous code runs:

From the screenshot above, expressions that do not execute are greyed out (line 10).

As soon the execute, they are vividly colored.

You can always check the time-forward execution of your code :six: and search in it :seven:. Now your usual program search is unified. In addtion to typical text controls, you can filter by code, state values, or visual elements.


## You are all set on web logging and breakpointing.

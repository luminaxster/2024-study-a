# Training Task: Click counter mismatch 

## Experiment Focus

As you work, you should externalize your thoughts and approach while you solve the problem. As we are examining use of the programming and debugging tools, you should refrain from **AI** or **Stack Overflow** queries but may consult other forms of documentation or search engines.

## Objective

Locate JS code from a web app, and gather debugging information(console logs or breakpoints).


## Task Description

Interact with a web app to follow the behavior of your code in terms of data, execution, and output flow.

## Logic Roadblock

The button content has a mismatch with the actual times it has been clicked. After some clicks it shows nothing.

## Task Completion
You have explain the contents of the variable `array`, how it is referenced in the web app output's button `Click me!`, and the callback effects on clicking that element.

## Estimated Completion Time
10 minutes.

### Task Completion Checklist
- [ ] Explained the contents of the variable `array`.
- [ ] Located button `click me!` in the your app output and how it uses `array`.
- [ ] Explained the effects of clicking the button `click me!` after some clicks.
- [ ] Fixed the misbehaving click effects.

## Task Background

None.

## Programming Background

Recommended: JavaScript programming experience, particularly in GUI and user event handling.

### Relevant JS Methods

- [`document.getElementById("myId")`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById#syntax): obtains are reference to a DOM element with the property `id` set to `myId`, such as `<div id="myId"></div>`. 

- [`domElement.addEventListener("click", eventHandler)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#syntax): subscribe DOM elements to “click” events such as selection changes due to user interaction.

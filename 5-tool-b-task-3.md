### Task: React callback not working

## Objective
Fix the functionality of a React component (`ItemModule`) to allow updating its `name`.

## Task Description
You are working within a React application where a `ItemModule` component. The `RepeatModule` component currently prepares this for `ItemModule`s .

## Logic Roadblock
The current implementation does not register user actions on the `ItemModule` component. The component uses clicks to updates based on user interaction.

## Task Completion
Your implementation should enable the `ItemModule` to make trigger changes when is clicked.

## Experiment Focus
As you work, you should externalize your thoughts and approach while you solve the problem. As we are examining use of the programming and debugging tools, you should refrain from AI or Stack Overflow queries but may consult other forms of documentation.

### Estimated Completion Time
15 minutes.

### Task Completion Checklist
- [ ] Analyze the current `ItemModule` component implementation.
- [ ] Verify the mechanism to update the `RepeatModule` component's value from the parent component.
- [ ] Ensure the `ItemModule` component remains a controlled component, and support user actions.
- [ ] Test the updated functionality to confirm that `RepeatModule` and `ItemModule` in the app.

## Task Background

### Understanding Controlled Components in React
- A component in React may have properties such data and actions. It receives its current value as a prop and notifies changes through event handling callbacks.

### Current Implementation Details
- The `ItemModule` component uses props from the parent component.
- The component updates when a user clicks through the `handleChange` method.

## Programming Background
Recommended: Understanding of functional componennts in React, including props, and component lifecycle.

### Relevant React Concepts
- Props in React: Read-only components that are used to pass data from a parent to a child component.
- State Management: React's mechanism for controlling component data across render cycles.
